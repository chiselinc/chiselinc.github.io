*This is the first in a series of 29 posts I'll put online throughout February 2020. In my own tongue-in-cheek version of "publish or perish," I will tackle my decade-long writer's block by posting one distinct, at least semi-complete, thought here every day this month.*

In December 2018-ish, I first started researching for this conceptualized post series, Git Gud, to compile cross-disciplinary takes on learning, awareness, productivity, and time management. Since then, I've tightly circled in upon my gathered resources, and started to connect the dots with yarn like a paranoid self-employed detective. Patterns that were useful to my over-analytic mindset emerged, and those patterns led me to identify pragmatic tools to implement in my daily life. 

**TL;DR** *Focus*, even on things you're deeply passionate about, doesn't always come automatically or easily. Tightly zooming in the lens of your mind's eye from the complex big picture to the next actionable task at hand can help keep you moving ahead reliably even during tougher times.

Curiously, the most useful of these tools are also the simplest. They feel almost trite: just "be here now" and you'll overcome your greatest psychic challenges. It's true though: face into the fear, own your feelings about it, endure in the moment and your brain will learn that the fear anxiety feeds on is a falsehood. 

*Side note*: The work of [Jocko Willink](https://jockopodcast.com/) and [Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/) were of crucial use as I tried to grok this at a deeper level. Additionally, [the Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and [David Allen's GTD structure](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) are both excellent jumping-off points to explore mainstream productivity-hacking. I use a lot of terminology from David Allen in my own system as sketched out below.

Personally, I'm still struggling to engage in any activities within even a stone's throw of mindfulness without descending into preventative panic. I'm working on it. In the meantime, concrete and pragmatic guidelines to implement in the day-to-day rule supreme for me. By setting design walls around my immediate and mid-term goals, and enforcing consistency and repetition in my routines. In short, I'm running my personal life more like it's an organization, and that's been delivering slow but steady results.

Edwin Locke's framework of **SMART Goals** (*Specific*, *Measurable*, *Attainable*, *Relevant*, and *Time Bound*) provides another great set of guidelines to shift your practice from "scribbling down vague promises I made to people" to "setting incremental goals which build upon one another to support future moonshot pursuits." [Great 2-Pager available, PDF Warning!](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Time_SetGoals_LA.pdf)

I'll use my own rough-around-the-edges accountability self-dare as an example, since this post is the kickoff to the attempted 29-day writing spree that will result, and I reflected upon the SMART goal framework as I crafted it.

I *specified* where I will post my writing, and what is required to "count" (completing a thought, as starting stub posts and leaving them as drafts is the specific problem I'm tackling). This is *measurable* in the sense that it will be posted to the public internet, and I find it personally *attainable* precisely because I left out any specifics on word count. For days where I'm really busy, I have plenty of "smaller thoughts" I'd love to put out there. 

The overall proposed undertaking is *relevant* because my desired professional path involves a whole bunch of "making my thoughts concrete on the page" and I've been knowingly running from that for too long. And finally, the goal as framed is indeed quite *Time Bound*- I was tickled pink that it's a leap year, and decided to go with the month-long approach, as it's something I can very clearly see the end of (and most of my heavy technical workload for courses comes due in March-April).

*Focus* isn't about tightening some sort of mental muscle, as I long assumed-- our brains are naturally kind of bad at it, even moreso with the proliferation of omnipresent technology. It's an individual failing to struggle with focus, and the problem is best tackled at first by ruthlessly culling distractions, and setting space for very specific tasks to take place. 

Perhaps most crucially, *tasks* are not *projects*. A task in my personal system's definition must take less than two hours to complete, and should be summarized with a main noun and action verb. It can have extensive detail from there, as much as is needed to provide the context and scope of the task. 

"*Review Financial Statements*" is a project. "*Download financial statements from 2008-2010 and highlight relevant line items*" is a proper task. I don't want to sit down to "Review Financial Statements" - it will take about 30 seconds to even properly recall the scope of such a project, and it's intimidating as hell. If I have "Review Financial Statements" as a standing item in my Projects list on Trello, each week I can generate a less intimidating "Next Action item" of about 30 minutes to 1 hour's duration, which I can schedule into my week in order to chip away at the beast that we call fiscal responsibility.

In my current base system, I have the following components and elements:

* A "running inbox" for thoughts, suggestions, and to-dos (Trello "add card" widget on main Android desktop sends to a list which is sorted at least twice a week);

* Structured Trello lists of projects, responsibilities, and commitments, which I review at least weekly and generate "Next Action" tasks from;

* Running Trello lists for "Someday/Maybe" ideas, stuff to read, look up, watch, or listen to;

* An "active projects" basket, keeping paper resources and folders for short term projects a bit more accessible than my long-term hanging storage (and I've scheduled in a weekly flip-through to pull new projects and action items from this basket);

* three time-blocked sections a week with printed, laminated processing checklists I can zip through with a whiteboard marker and stay on task instead of trying to reinvent the organizational wheel each week. 

With regards to this final item, I don't have the focus or constitution to do a single "Weekly Review" all in one sitting as David Allen recommends. I thought it over in a couple separate brainstorming sessions, reflecting on my particular needs and the different "sectors" of my life and grouped task types.

My current routine, then, involves 8 hours a week timeblocked on my calendar as follows:

* **Monday** 3.5 hours (includes regular breaks) dealing with project management, meta-admin, and urgent comms and email;
* **Tuesday** 1 hour email inbox blitz of actionable but less urgent tasks, triangulated from the previous day's session;
* **Friday** 3.5 hours (includes regular breaks) processing paper inbox, plotting out upcoming week's calendar and schedule, and rotating through household cleanup and chores.

For more than a decade of technically "adult" life, I kind of drifted without structure, fighting fires as they arose and trying to keep on top of life's tiny bits of bullshit. It's clear some brains can handle that, but I'm an indecisive relationally-minded daydreamer. 

By sticking these review sessions firmly on my calendar, I've taken some pressure off my already thinly stretched personal RAM. Maybe some weeks I'm sick or struggling, and hit little to none of the benchmarks I've set, with no checkmarks checked. That's fine, because I'll pick up the slack when I bounce back, without having to construct my organizational strategy from first principles each time anew.
