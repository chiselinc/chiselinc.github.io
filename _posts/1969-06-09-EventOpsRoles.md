I have more than 3 very active years of experience designing, managing, and implementing tech industry events large and small.

I cut my teeth for event management as a member in [an anarchic Bitcoin education space in Vancouver](https://www.dctrl.ca), and scaled up to working on larger global conferences by summer of 2017.

My strengths include:
* lead-in planning for contingencies, covering everything from insurance/liability and venue relations to catering and livestream;
* collecting and organizing speaker relations content and communications flow;
* designing and implementing ambitious but achievable scheduled timetables;
* ensuring effective day-of AV capture and social media live documentation.

I prefer not to be involved in the fundraising side of projects where I'm performing short term contract work; I find the "asking for money" muscle very difficult to flex, and I save all that strength currently for advocating for my own livable wage, and the few volunteer passion projects I choose to devote time to. I will always offer to volunteer for lower budget events that I believe in, and will work as hard as if the team were paying me.

## Compensation Expectation

I will accept larger leadership roles (operations management) on fixed contract terms, usually at a rate of $1000-4000usd monthly depending on the scope of the role and responsibilities for lead-in. For more informal roles where lead-in involvement is not required, but help is required with the actual event execution, I'm happy to do an hourly contract arrangement, as long as travel expenses are covered as well.

For these "day-of" operations roles, my rates start at $40usd/hr for volunteer management, overseeing venue relations and logistics, or a prominent MC/host role; lower rates are available for stageside timekeeping at $30/hr, and livetweeting the event with proper linkouts to livestreams and speaker profiles at $25/hr.
