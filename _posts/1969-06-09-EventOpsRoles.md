# Event Operations Roles

## Experience
* 10+ years as an informal community organizer (noise music scene & Infoshop collective)
* 4+ years running infosec, Bitcoin, and decentralized technology meetups
* 2+ years managing professional tech conferences large and small


## Background
I cut my teeth for crypto event management as a member in [an anarchic Bitcoin education space in Vancouver](https://www.dctrl.ca), and scaled up to working on larger global conferences by summer of 2017. 

My greatest achievement in life thus far has been [Dogecon Vancouver](http://dogecon.fun/mainpages/memories), which will be returning to the world in Summer of 2020.

## Strengths
* pragmatic lead-in planning for contingencies and crowd control;
* implementing a system for speaker relations with a strong communication flow;
* designing and implementing ambitious but achievable content timetables, including parallel tracks;
* ensuring effective day-of AV capture and live social media documentation.

I prefer not to be involved in the fundraising side of projects where I'm performing short term contract work. However, I will always offer to volunteer for lower budget events that I believe in, and will work as hard as if the team were paying me.

## Compensation

* **Full-on Conference Management Roles** - negotiated on a per-contract basis, *$1000-$4000 USD* monthly flat rate depending on scope of role and lead-in prep time

* **Consultation & Support on Smaller Events** - happy to do an hourly rate of *$25 USD* for smaller/non-profit groups and *$75-$125 USD* for corporate/private sector affairs

### Rates for Smaller Scope/Defined Roles

Beyond higher level management, I can fill pretty much any role in the hierarchy for day-of operations, especially:

* Lead volunteer coordinator; Venue relations/on-site logistics contact point; Prominent MC/Host roles: *$40 USD/hr*
* Stageside timekeeper/head usher (I have a full set of "time left:" signs, large clock, etc): *$30 USD/hr*
* Livetweeting (with accurate & timely linkouts to livestreams and speaker profiles): *$25 USD/hr*
