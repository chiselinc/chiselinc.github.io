# Writing and Documentation Roles

## Experience

* 16+ years as a writing tutor and freelance copyeditor
* 12+ years of high level critical theory and academic writing
* 3+ years informal documentation in Linux and tech communities online
* prior experience as independent music journalist

## Background

My long-form work includes a psychoanalytic theory of the roots of addiction in my undergraduate thesis- "too much [fun]"; an analysis of the complex power dynamics throughout the first one hundred years of information and communication technology ["Stuck in Cyberspace"](http://stuckincyber.space); and a thorough analysis of user-facing terms and conditions within the biometric tracking hardware industry - ["Human Data Commons Quantified Self Report Card 2017"](https://humandatacommons.org/quantified-self/).

My foray into technical writing is more recent: I began populating Github repos for technical FAQs and readmes throughout the past 3 years. Over that time, I've focused my technical work within the field of Linux peer support, especially for Kubuntu distro and its corresponding software. 

Additionally, as I've gone deeper down the rabbithole with programming for the Bitcoin protocol, I've opened my door to technical writing projects in this area as well.

## Strengths
* expansive vocabulary and sophisticated research process
* delivery of high-quality contract writing based on collaborative timelines
* specializing in metaphor construction and translating higher-level concepts to laypeople

## Compensation
Any contracts offered should work out to at least *$50-$60 USD/hr* for more challenging technical writing and *$30-$40 USD/hr* for less technical styles like cultural commentary or journalism.
