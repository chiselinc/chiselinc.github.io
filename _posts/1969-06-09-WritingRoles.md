I have more than 15 years' experience as a freelance copyeditor and writing tutor. For that same span of time, I've produced high level critical theory and social commentary work within an academic setting. My long-form work includes a psychoanalytic theory of the roots of addiction in my undergraduate thesis- "too much [fun]"; an analysis of the complex power dynamics throughout the first one hundred years of information and communication technology ["Stuck in Cyberspace"](http://stuckincyber.space); and a thorough analysis of user-facing terms and conditions within the biometric tracking hardware industry - ["Human Data Commons Quantified Self Report Card 2017"](https://humandatacommons.org/quantified-self/).

My foray into technical writing is more recent: I began populating Github repos for technical FAQs and readmes throughout the past 3 years. Over that time, I've focused my technical work within the field of Linux peer support, especially for Kubuntu distro and its corresponding software. Additionally, as I've gone deeper down the rabbithole with programming for the Bitcoin protocol, I've opened my door to technical writing projects in this area as well. I genuinely request rates of around $50-60usd/hr or well-defined whole-contract rates for technical writing.
