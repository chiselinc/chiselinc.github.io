## Background
I have loved education since the first day I went to kindergarten, and to me, teaching and learning are deeply intertwined and symbiotic. I was a peer tutor from my first year of university (2003) onward, and I've been producing free community education resources throughout my entire tenure in the decentralized technology industry.

## Strengths
* helping folks who would consider themselves less technically inclined achieve "aha" moments with disruptive technology
* designing hands-on and participatory activities for small groups, and breakout discussion prompts for larger ones
* ensuring that attendees walk away with a few strong salient points, and the roadmap to learn more on their own

## Compensation
If you are interested in getting started with Linux, Bitcoin, or learning to code, and you are low-income, reach out to me about scheduling a call: I'm happy to help one-on-one in these areas for a much lower rate, and in some cases for free.


I can also do larger scale education. The following rough estimate rates are based on the preparation time required for each topic. *Grassroots* is my shorthand here for smaller groups and non-profits, whereas *Corporate* stands for larger and/or private sector companies.

### Technology Topics

**Intro to Bitcoin** ------------------------ $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate

**Intro to Decentralization** --------------- $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate


**Intro to Cryptoeconomics** ------------------- $50hr grassroots / $150hr corporate

**Creative Commons and Open Source Licensing**--- $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate

### Academic Topics

**WTF Is Critical Theory?** ----------------- $25hr small group of <30

**Foucault: Critical Theory's Bad Boy** ------- $25hr small group of <30

**Jacques Lacan: In On the Joke** ----------- $25hr small group of <30
