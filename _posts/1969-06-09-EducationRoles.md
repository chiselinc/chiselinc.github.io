I have loved education since the first day I went to kindergarten, and to me, teaching and learning are deeply intertwined and symbiotic.

I have been helping people set up their first Bitcoin wallet hands-on since 2016, and am always happy to do so. There are some really important principles to keep in mind as you start out with Bitcoin-- the most crucial being about proper safekeeping of your private keys-- and it's great to have a friend to guide you along!

I can also do larger scale education; the following rough estimate rates are based on the preparation time required for each topic, and rate is scaled between small/grassroots and large/corporate settings.

**Intro to Bitcoin** ------------------------ $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate

**Intro to Decentralization** --------------- $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate

**Intro to Ethereum** ----------------------- $50hr grassroots / $150hr corporate

**Intro to Cryptoeconomics** ---------------- $50hr grassroots / $150hr corporate

**Intro to Free and Open Source Software**--- $25hr grassroots / $125hr corporate


**WTF Is Critical Theory?** ----------------- $25hr small group of <20

**Foucault: Critical Theory Bad Boy** ------- $25hr small group of <20

**Jacques Lacan: In On the Joke** ----------- $25hr small group of <20
