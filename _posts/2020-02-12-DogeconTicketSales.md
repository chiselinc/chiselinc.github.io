title: Dogecon Ticket Sales

---

We made a vague but firm commitment to get Dogecon 2020 tickets live on sale by Valentine's Day- the day after tomorrow. This public promise was largely made in order to keep this early deliverable on track, as there are so many balls in the air with locking down venues, speaker and performer outreach, and fundraising. 

Getting tickets live is crucial, especially as we have a wildly different strategy this year- one that's deeply aligned with the complexity of cryptoeconomics itself. You see, people (myself included!) behave pretty badly when it comes to things like "planning ahead," "RSVPing," etc. 

So as much as I was initially averse to the incentive structures of rising-price tickets, the many lessons we learned last time around in 2018 show that it's pretty damn necessary to get any sort of consistent early read on projected attendance.

So, while I think our prices are still insanely fair, especially when compared across the industy (and measured up against experiential value) we are indeed going along with the classic "Act now- limited time offer!" style of ticket marketing. And honestly, given that we're being super transparent about how that timeline and its various fixed prices look, I feel fine about that.
