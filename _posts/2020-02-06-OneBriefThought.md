title: One Brief Thought
---

I'm really keeping with this pledge despite the advent of exhaustion and the ever-taunting background noise of chronic pain.

Keeping it real brief tonight. And unfortunately, pretty cynical.

Just this thought:

You can try your hardest, put in work day after day, do everything right to the utmost degree possible, and still face nothing but pain and suffering. I wouldn't know for sure because I am sure as fuck not even close to doing everything right. But the new fresh hell with each further shift of this slipped disc situation- well, I'm getting a taste of the worst case scenario.

Every time I think I've met my pain threshold, I'm wrong. I haven't yet passed out from pain, though I came close when I had to ride a very bumpy bus. 

Is there a point at which stoicism isn't even optional, it just happens or you die from pain?

Is there a point at which the witch, fully aflame, transcends the flesh?

I really don't want to find out up close and personal.
