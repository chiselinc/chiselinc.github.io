title: Story of Dogecon Vancouver

---

Well this is sort of a cop-out placeholder in lieu of my 4th post. Luckily, in setting up this post I figured out why my previous ones weren't properly publishing in Jekyll, so I'll try to do some housekeeping this week. For now, the creative output is more important than the technical leaps ahead.

I've been wildly productive in getting Dogecon 2020 going, so in place of a properly formed post, I'll share the powerpoint presentation I've been crafting for my Document Design class at UBC's iSchool. Tomorrow at midnight, I hand in this and a ten-ish page reflective paper on the process of creating a simple narrative presentation based on the principles Nancy Duarte outlines in texts like Slide:ology and Resonate.

It's been a frustrating and incredibly useful exercise in revisiting what I think I know about powerpoint, and sloughing tons and tons of text to the cutting room floor, so to speak. I exercised much more constraint than I usually do, in terms of stylistic choices and their boundaries, but at the same time I tried to be a bit more ambitious and adventurous in some ways.
