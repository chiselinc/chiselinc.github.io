title: Dogecon Information Needs
---

The format of my post tonight will kill two birds with one stone: I need to "self-interview" on Dogecon's organizational information needs, to finalize the evaluation for my database design term project. 

I formally interviewed our nonprofit's president with this same loose set of questions/prompts, and will be using those answers, my own thoughts, and the feedback from the attendee survey to craft the initial design for the backend of Dogecon 2020's event management platform, which will be hosted at www.dogecon.lol.

I'm mainly doing this because I'm not going to break my public posting promise, but I'm insanely busy researching and planning for both Dogecon and my grad classes, but it will likely hold at least some independent value.

**First, please give a brief description of your organization.**
Carpe Lunam Events Association is a member-funded nonprofit in BC, which is basically like a community club format. We formed it in order to successfully carry out the Dogecon Vancouver biennial celebration, but our larger mission as stated in our constitution is to encourage decentralization education, and bridge our local Vancouver community with the larger disruptive tech field.

**How would you say this organization stands out from others in the industry?**
We chose the nonprofit format so that we, ya know, could ground ourselves outside of the prioritization of profit. I had run so many crypto conferences for other people, and always saw when organizers could make a profit, it turned very quickly into pay-to-speak affairs. We want to make sure content stays symbiotic to sponsorship, not beholden to it, and create space for the organic community of grassroots crypto nerds to celebrate, perform, learn, and play together. 

**What sort of information do you think we need to communicate to attendees?**
What's going on, where and when, but more importantly, what opportunities they have to participate hands-on and shape this. We need to figure out how to appropriately communicate how wildly different this is from a normal "conference" format without sounding like raving decentralist lunatics. Also, folks who are new to Vancouver will need help and direction getting around and getting their personal needs met.

**What sort of information do we need to collect from attendees and potentially store?**
*Vitally* - what email we can reach them at, whether they have any dire food allergies or pressing needs in their time at Dogecon.

*Less Vitally* - food preferences, voluntary social demographics (where'd you come to Dogecon from, and what drew you here?), self-selected bio and preferred social media contact links.

Whether they want to participate in the open tracks, and if so, when and what.

**What is the most important information to keep updated during the event?**
The Schedule. Where and when things are happening on a larger fixed scale; and in some highlighted area of the site, *where there are people right now and approximately what they are doing.* How to reach out to staff if you need help. How to get around Vancouver, if any weird transit/protest/catastrophe things arise.

**What information should very few people have access to?**
Logins and account access info. Any even remotely identifiable real-world information about attendees, *especially* anything beyond what they've voluntarily posted on their own profiles.
