I have long wanted to construct this statement, following the shining example of (Bob Summerwill)[https://bobsummerwill.com/conflict-of-interests-statement/] and others for ethical best practices in our field.

I've been held back by the daunting scale of this undertaking-- I have very few actual financial entanglements with crypto ecosystem projects, but many fluid relationships and community connections. I'm still determining where I draw the defining line for non-financial conflicts of interest, and this statement will thus be an iterative versioned work in progress, as time and sanity allow. Future versions will link back to their predecessors... much like some sort of chain of information blocks.

## Paid Roles

I am currently engaged in a few short term private sector contracts, primarily focused on technical writing, curriculum development, and community building. If I take any committed roles in projects, I'll append them here in future. I'm looking for one or more "forever homes" within teams focused on edge case, privacy-focused platforms that benefit populations who most need censorship-resistant sound money *today*.

## Crypto Holdings

I diverge from many in tradition, as I've treated my crypto accounting with "Last In, First Out" principles since I first received BTC as a primary source of income in 2016. Thus I aim, even in times of fiat hardship, to retain my "original holdings" for both Bitcoin and Ether, so as not to have a bunch of hassle in my taxes. 

My approximate longterm holdings are 1.5 BTC and 10 ETH, each "HODLed" since 2016. These are in deep cold storage and even if you take a wrench to my skull you can't gain access so don't try. My stretch goal in lieu of a retirement plan is to stack a further 0.6 BTC before the next bull run, so that I can join the one million club.

## Quasi-Maximalism

I greatly adore many communities and projects that are building upon ETH, ETC, DOGE, and a few other platforms. The way the end-of-2017 market nosedive went down, and the way various industry actors behaved, returned my economic view to its strong Bitcoin maximalist roots. 

I believe in the longest chain of Proof-of-Work mining, accumulative network effects for security, and a firmly defined monetary policy. I've managed to maintain friendships with many folks who don't share this belief, and I don't plan to spend much time trolling on the matter. 

However, I think it's important to put this bias out there loud and clear. A few thousand greedy and poorly planned ICOs ruined the whole sphere, and showed just how green our industry still is.

I believe we can transcend the "tokenized presale" crowdfunding model, and that in fact, we desperately need to in order to progress in societal evolution. I am interested in supporting any unique fundraising experiments that transcend the plutocratic bureaucracy of traditional VC on the one hand, and the tulip mania pyramid schemery of ICOs/IEOs/etc on the other.

## Guiding Beliefs

Super work in progress-- here are a few of the ideas/beliefs that most strongly guide my decisionmaking on this Earth.

* I care more about Davey than Goliath - I have an inherent chip on my shoulder against groups or leaders who seek to consolidate power and exploit their infrastructural advantages over the "little guy."

* All labour should be treated with dignity; all workers and their roles have value. (note: *work*. not *rent-seeking*.)

* As much as is reasonably possible, knowledge and information should be freely shared, iteratively improved, remixed, and revisited for verification/peer review.

* We stop growing and improving, as humans and as professionals, once we stop critically reflecting on the possibility that our beliefs and positions could be wrong.
