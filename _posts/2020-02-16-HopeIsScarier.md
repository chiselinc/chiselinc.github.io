Since I got a new mattress last week, the gradually worsening spinal pain issues I've had for almost a year have been significantly slowed- I've even had a few comparatively new days.

As someone who was a bit of an Eeyore the Donkey even before this recent bout of pain cropped up, though, I'm not sure precisely how I feel about that. In this particular case, I'm deeply fucking relieved because my daily life was becoming some sort of a cruel joke, a bad trip where expectations of pain gate theory were just smashed again and again, with perverse new ways to hurt.

On the two good-ish days I've had this week, not completely floored/exhausted/preoccupied by the pain, it kind of put a responsibility back into my hands that I haven't faced for awhile. I mean, I'm still slaying it when it comes to externally forced deadlines, like school assignments and has-to-be-done life admin shit.

But as soon as the pain started tanking my days, I put my own dreams aside. I stopped rapping for long periods of time. I kept up Dogecon prep but that was about it. I stopped dreaming of how I could contribute to the world around me because I genuinely couldn't picture an immediate future in which I'd be able to do so.

In about 32 hours, I will be sitting in an office near Vancouver General Hospital where I will get the presumably brief spinal surgery consult I've been desperately awaiting. To some degree, I've put my life into stasis in the months since my condition started severely degrading again- right around the holidays. 

It's intimidating to un-pause my life, to feel entirely responsible for my dreams and passions. To not have the excuse of this breathtaking overwhelming pain. I will be glad when that day fully comes but I hope I don't quickly forget what this was like, and let my gratitude fade. I'm letting myself hope that there's an end to this, that it's not a life sentence, but that's scary as all hell.
