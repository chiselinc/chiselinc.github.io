title: Nausea Like Sartre
---

This is going to be a difficult one, but it's necessary for me to explore and it might as well be in a painfully open fashion like I live most of my life.

This is also the first time I've begun one of these blog posts in the daytime. Today is the halfway mark for the month-long experiment, and every single post before this one has had the old Wow-book cracked open at 11pm or later. In panic. In distress. In not-wanting-to-deal-with-this. So maybe the floodgates are starting to open.

Because this is a weird personal topic that I really am not looking forward to facing head-on, but like most things in life, I'm positive it doesn't have a chance of improving until I do.

In addition to the life-arresting levels of chronic pain I've been fine with sharing about, I have some other longstanding health issues that really complicate the matter. I've seen some mutuals on Weird Twitter/Queer Twitter openly addressing similar issues lately, and it's forced me to turn the flashlight back on my own heart- or in this case my own brain&stomach.

Living takes guts, literally. I'm not the only person who has some weird broken loops in the interaction between my central nervous system (command ops) and my digestive system- from what I understand, the two systems start as one in the womb, and are intricately intertwined for life. 

I know that all the fucked up stuff I put myself through from adolescence onward has manifested in a self-perpetuating literal sickness. I know it's almost entirely psychosomatic, it *must* be. The earliest symptoms of this- the development of ulcers in my late teens- was directly linked to stress and psychological turmoil. My whole life, my brain's been making my stomach sick, and the whole damn time I keep flashing back to Sartre's *Nausea*.

# The Spooky Start

Here's where the potentially problematic disclosures start. Well, I was never planning to go into law enforcement or anything like that. So groundwork-laying time. 

I went to an academically rigorous university at the age of 16 on full scholarship- two years before I would have graduated high school, that was kind of my college's whole deal. They took kids who loved to learn so much that high school felt limiting for us, and let us loose together in a small woodlands playground in the Massachusetts Berkshires.

I was very, very well-behaved when I arrived at that school, a few months after my 16th birthday. This did not last for a week, and I somehow managed to ride the rollercoaster of a few years' stretch getting straight A's in a challenging program while tripping on psychedelics multiple times a week. **I cannot emphasize enough how bad I think this was for my developing brain.** I've done many things I regret in my life, but this would probably top them- in some ways, I may never overcome the depths of insatiable existential *need* I created in myself by dabbling too early in this regard.

No matter, it's done. What that turned into, with my daredevil ways and transdude-before-trans-was-a-mainstream-thing desperation to seem like the biggest badass in the crew, was me taking on the role of "guinea pig" when the campus "chemists" got in new shipments of experimental research chemicals.
