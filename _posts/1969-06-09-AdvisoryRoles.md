I am best suited to short-term advisory and consulting positions in the following areas of specialization:

* If you have an out-of-the-box Point of Sale software solution for supply chain or e-commerce, and you need an initial setup and inventory database entry, I can work to customize the install for your specialized business needs.
* I can do small group facilitation, corporate consulting, or initial feedback rounds around issues of inclusion regarding gender identity and ethical product design.
* I will give feedback on whether your project *needs* a blockchain, and can serve the role of a condensed critical firing squad for any tokenization/alt-coin project in its early stages, to point out the many ways in which you could accomplish your proposed goal without excessive blockchainization.
