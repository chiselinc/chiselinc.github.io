I first fell in love with technology because of the Free and Open Source Software movement, and my intellectual orientation is still rooted in the values from that scene.

## Experience
* past corporate secretary and legal assistant for public TSX-traded company
* implemented effective operations workflow and documentation for multiple startups
* learned from the best of the best mentors in both critical theory and cryptocurrency

## Background
My Community Psychology M.A. degree mostly focused on how to evaluate, recommend, and implement data-driven initiatives in the non-profit social services sector. 

This professional training, combined with the cryptoeconomic cynicism of my Bitcoiner origins, allows me to quickly diagnose potential pain points in your blockchain-related game plan.

## Strengths
* preparing you to accurately defend why your project needs a blockchain-- go up against me to tighten your elevator pitch
* when possible, providing ideas on ways to solve the described problem with a less resource-intensive solution, or at least highlight areas for more R&D
* catching potential cultural sensitivities early- I will provide well-organized notes on any way your project might infuriate the public, or get meme'd on by clever young folk

## Compensation

*I don't have bandwidth to commit to anything longer-term than 3 calls/meetings max per project, giving initial round critical feedback before you take it on the road for fundraising.*

It will be reward enough if, in my lifetime, I can redpill one or two projects into not creating an unnecessarily tokenized project when they can just craft regular software, thus I'm willing to pitch a way low rate for this.

If we do it by audio, it's *$25 USD/hr* per call. If we meet in person, *$15 USD/hr* and coffee's on your team. If you find the work useful, please tip me in Bitcoin, I'm doing God's work here.

And who knows? [Maybe your hyperblockchainization project is the one that will change my mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8craCGpgs), and I'll have to update this website again.
