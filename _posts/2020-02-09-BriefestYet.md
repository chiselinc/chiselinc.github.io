title: Briefest Yet
---

And as per the title, this post will be the briefest yet. I almost skipped, because getting to bed and getting on top of the huge pile of correspondence etc. that's awaiting my attention tomorrow is priority number one.

So the full thought is: sometimes trying to get some damn sleep (even if you're in a situation where sleep is not particularly restful, and causes physical pain) is more important to the net sum of your goals than any single goal or commitment can be on its own. Good night.
