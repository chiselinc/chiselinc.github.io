title: The Limits of Our Bandwidth
---

Because I've struggled so much with discipline throughout my adult life, there hasn't been much rhyme or reason to my patterns of interaction with the world. My ability to engage with my surroundings in a functional way has seemed to ebb and flow without reason.

Now that I've really gritted my teeth and doubled down, I'm seeing that maybe a lot of the time that I became aimless, shut down, and couldn't make progress for weeks at a time was just a buffer overflow, a massive attack on my available mental bandwidth that had ripple effects for some time after.

As I noted in a few earlier posts, sometimes it's the damn resting that matters most of all. I went from a great pain day to a not so great pain day, and I'm going to rest and reset my bandwidth in the hopes that I can revisit the great pain day experience.
