title: Gendered Healthcare
---

Keeping it incredibly brief today, as I'm still exhausted from yesterday and have an exciting opportunity on the horizon tomorrow. 

This may be somewhat offensive but as someone with longstanding "Gender Trouble" I can't bring myself to care about others' ruffled feathers.

I have noticed a distinctive, consistent overall pattern in which male- and female-presenting healthcare professionals behave in some overall recognizable ways along those gender lines.

Consistently, when a male physician enters the room, it's about His Authority. He takes charge, sometimes not even seeming to make any real eye contact to establish rapport. It's a rapidfire line of questions, coming from the perspective of an Expert of Medicine who will maaaybe take a moment to fit your frail condition into his worldview, and dispense wisdom/treatment. (Do I sound bitter? lol)


In contrast, my two whirlwind specialist consults in Vancouver hospitals yesterday left me largely in the hands of female doctors. Just as I've seen at UBC, these practitioners came from a communication-centric paradigm. They introduced themselves, explained what I could expect as they described my condition, sketched out what the surgery would look like and described potential complications. They sat with me, made eye contact, sought to connect and understand.

Obviously this empathy means the world to me, on a surface level. I'm there, filling out surveys which ask me to quantify the impact that this pain has had on my career and mobility, surrounded by patients 30 years older than me. I need a bit of kindness.

But more objectively, the patient-centric approach reaps more information. When I see the rapid-fire disinterested doctors, I always feel flustered and rushed and forget a thing or two. In taking my medical history, gentle and supportive, the doctors yesterday coaxed out things I might have forgotten about otherwise.

If this is actually a discernable pattern of any sort, it's just reducable in my opinion to socially learned gender roles. Little girls are taught explicitly to "think of others' needs," and the grounding for being a good host, a good supportive friend, etc., starts young. Little boys are taught to strike out in the world, master things, become an expert. It absolutely makes sense that things might tend in these directions.

But I'm getting too frail in every sense of the word to grapple with cold male doctors. It's making my gender cynical detrans ass start eyeing feminism hungrily again. What wave are we at? Am I welcome in your ranks if I feel like a dude inside but experience the world as a woman, with all the shittiness that entails?

For now, it's just surviving time. And I'm a little proud I'm sticking with this blog-writing self-dare.
