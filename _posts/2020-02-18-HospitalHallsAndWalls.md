title: Hospital Halls and Walls

I spent a lot of time silently weeping in and near hospital buildings today. It's pretty heavy.

I also walked 15000+ steps which for my sedentary, computer-bound ass is a HUGE deal to be celebrated.

But the hospitals. The hospitals led to the conclusion that I will be *allowed* to spend more time within their halls and walls. That was the best outcome I could have hoped for. Pretty macabre overall but this is how things stand.

How things stand is that I'm happy and grateful that I'll be spending more times in hospitals.

At least the area of Vancouver where most of this will be going down is beautiful. Mount Pleasant, so appropriately named, honestly gives you weirdo little slice-views like the above that are unlike anywhere I had seen before.

Seeing the city looming down a corridor, and mountains looming even larger behind it, it's an experience I lacked growing up around New York/New England. 

The East Coast is older and crowded and overgrown. If you're going to have a city back home, it's city all the way through, gargantuan and sprawling.

There's none of this weird magic like Vancouver, where you can be standing in something that looks very much like a suburban soccer field, and see a clear snapshot of skyscrapers within a half an hour's walk.

Anyways these hospitals. These hospitals will be the death of me lol. I'm so glad to be moving things forward and I have to remember to just keep strengthening and exercising. The stronger my core is the quicker I will recover from back surgery, especially since it will put me out of commission for some time and I'll presumably lose more muscle mass then.

I am going to be 33 years old in a few months and I will not let the fucked up shit that's been going on with my back for the past year destroy my life.

I am going to get treatment and then I am going to get strong. Even if surgery doesn't relieve the pain (as they were very careful to emphasize many times- it's not guaranteed relief) it is the Nuclear Option with no other options beyond that besides "become a functional junkie."

With how my brain works, I think if I do the Nuclear option and it doesn't help, that will be enough for me to know that I just have to endure, and continue, and work hard no matter how bad it hurts.

This early, I'm still wishy washy. I'll give myself "days off from working" cos of the pain, which I can't afford to do, because I haven't accepted it as a fact of life. I sure as shit don't want to- that will be a certain form of giving up, giving up on it getting better.

But if it objectively, materially **won't** get better- I do the surgery and have poor results- then shit, I need to accept that fact in order to survive.

I'm getting ahead of myself, and publicly posting the neurotic rambling interior monologue that's constantly going on for me, I suppose. I'm not going back or reading or editing. That's not how this February experiment works. It's about getting it out there however I can. And the psychological results have been promising. So I'll just save and commit, in both senses. Commit this to git, and commit to those damn hospitals.
