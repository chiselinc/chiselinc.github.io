title: Nausea Like Sartre
---

This is going to be a difficult one, but it's necessary for me to explore and it might as well be in a painfully open fashion like I live most of my life.

This is also the first time I've begun one of these blog posts in the daytime. Today is the halfway mark for the month-long experiment, and every single post before this one has had the old Wow-book cracked open at 11pm or later. In panic. In distress. In not-wanting-to-deal-with-this. So maybe the floodgates are starting to open.

Because this is a weird personal topic that I really am not looking forward to facing head-on, but like most things in life, I'm positive it doesn't have a chance of improving until I do.

In addition to the life-arresting levels of chronic pain I've been fine with sharing about, I have some other longstanding health issues that really complicate the matter. I've seen some mutuals on Weird Twitter/Queer Twitter openly addressing similar issues lately, and it's forced me to turn the flashlight back on my own heart- or in this case my own brain&stomach.

Living takes guts, literally. I'm not the only person who has some weird broken loops in the interaction between my central nervous system (command ops) and my digestive system- from what I understand, the two systems start as one in the womb, and are intricately intertwined for life. 

I know that all the fucked up stuff I put myself through from adolescence onward has manifested in a self-perpetuating literal sickness. I know it's almost entirely psychosomatic, it *must* be. The earliest symptoms of this- the development of ulcers in my late teens- was directly linked to stress and psychological turmoil. My whole life, my brain's been making my stomach sick, and the whole damn time I keep flashing back to Sartre's *Nausea*.

# The Spooky Start

Here's where the potentially problematic disclosures start. Well, I was never planning to go into law enforcement or anything like that. So groundwork-laying time. 

I went to an academically rigorous university at the age of 16 on full scholarship- two years before I would have graduated high school, that was kind of my college's whole deal. They took kids who loved to learn so much that high school felt limiting for us, and let us loose together in a small woodlands playground in the Massachusetts Berkshires.

I was very, very well-behaved when I arrived at that school, a few months after my 16th birthday. This did not last for a week, and I somehow managed to ride the rollercoaster of a few years' stretch getting straight A's in a challenging program while tripping on psychedelics multiple times a week. **I cannot emphasize enough how bad I think this was for my developing brain.** I've done many things I regret in my life, but this would probably top them- in some ways, I may never overcome the depths of insatiable existential *need* I created in myself by dabbling too early in this regard.

No matter, it's done. What that turned into, with my daredevil ways and transdude-before-trans-was-a-mainstream-thing desperation to seem like the biggest badass in the crew, was me taking on the role of "guinea pig" when the campus "chemists" got in new shipments of experimental research chemicals.

# Flashback to A Trip Gone Weird

And so it was that on a weekday afternoon sometime in the Fall of 2004, I was lined up to try out a brand new shipment of what was presumably the [research chemical 2CB](https://erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb.shtml). Being a particularly enthusiastic and insecure daredevil degen, I decided to kick it off with a double dose. I bade the dealer farewell after downing the capsules and smoking a bowl, promising to return with notes the next day.

The psychedelic kicked in, strong, while I was still in the "main campus" sector of an incredibly small liberal arts college. In fact, we jokingly called it "baby college" cos of the age thing- you didn't *have* to come there before finishing high school, but the majority of us did. So inevitably, the staff and security policed us more closely. As the idiocy of my actions in this story illustrate, we were kids- dumb, dumb, dumbass kids.

So the drugs kicked in, my pupils were probably reaching for the margins, and I knew I had to make it back to my lodgings Tomb-Raider style, in broad daylight, ASAP. This wasn't the biggest deal in the world- about a five minute walk, up a path between all the freshman dorms, past the security shack, and across a lovely little courtyard. Pastoral New England delight.

... not quite, with a wrench in the works. As I started tripping very, very hard, and it became more difficult to string together the productive incremental steps for the objectively simple journey, something began to happen to my physical body. I was struck quite suddenly, and massively, with a psychological imperative to dry heave repeatedly.

# Don't Mind Me, Just Pukin' in the Garden

When you are violently hurling in public, even if nothing is coming out of your body except brisk puffs of air- well, ladies and germs, that's a real attention-grabber. The urgency of the situation escalated as the physical urgency pressed itself into my core muscles, wracking my body.

**Somebody was gonna notice this absolute nonsense.** And ask me what was up. And find out pretty quickly from my gibberish narrative that I was in an altered state.

The Tomb Raider plan became less joke, more necessity. I darted behind parked cars, trying to find a rhythm in between the wretching spasm of my abdomen's muscles and the steps I took. I would pause behind a rock, like Wile E. Coyote, let the nausea wash over me for a second, seeing if that lessened the waves after. (It didn't.)

# Our Antihero Manages a Brave Escape

I made it back to my little sophomore apartment, in the Mods as they called it. Still darting like a devious thief even once I reached the covers of the forest path. As I got to the back porch, I saw some sort of creature- I believe it was a possum- that was completely albino, with red eyes. We both froze for a second, and as I bent into another uncontrollable hurling motion, s/he darted under the porch. Spooky demon rat, in my zonked out perspective.

This is a long weird roundabout story, but so is Sartre's *Nausea* tbh. This won't compare to that but experientially, it was the goddamn same. Just like him, tripping and staring down the minute details of a tree, I was spun and forced to confront a world I didn't understand, seemingly meaningless, and watch it play with me.

Roundabout story but I'm convinced this is the origin point of a psychological nausea I've been afflicted with ever since. It's held me back from a lot, it always pops up just when I'm about to overcome some of my psychological limitations. It literally brings me to the floor, lying on the cool ground while I sweat with fear and wracked with uncontrollable spasms. 

Could this all be traced back to one bad trip? Or is it just pattern recognition overlaid on a genetic inevitability... that I would always end up with this weak stomach, and the horrifyingly vivid trip is just a marker along the way?
