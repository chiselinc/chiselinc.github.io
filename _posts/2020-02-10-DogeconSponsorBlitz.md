title: Dogecon Sponsorship Material Blitz

---

I've been incredibly heads-down developing graphic assets etc for the initial, and crucial, sponsor outreach we'll have to do to get base funding secured for venues etc for Dogecon 2020. So in lieu of a post, here's the 4-pager I've been working diligently on, which I'll hopefully get some feedback (beyond "wow crayola city" lol) on tomorrow.
