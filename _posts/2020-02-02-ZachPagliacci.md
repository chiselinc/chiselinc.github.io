[Zach Galifianakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwqc5t7OcLU) has been my favourite comedian for approaching a decade. Long before he was “the weirdo in the Hangover,” he was playing with the palette of mental illness in his standup comedy.

I’m still shocked that so little attention has been paid to [Visioneers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM480nMeTVw), the Orwellian dark comedy that Galifianakis carried effortlessly. It’s one of my top ten favourite movies of all time, and Zach brings the same brooding about-to-flip energy to his role as [Baskets the Clown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskets_(TV_series)).

It’s funny because I’ve fallen behind on the show by about a season, and apparently it ended last summer, so I’ll do one more dive in pursuit of closure. With Galifianakis characters, though, there’s often no such thing. His comedy hinges upon dissatisfaction, frustration, words left unspoken. See his [vodka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p0QtJMKt1s) [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EQcvKCFFW4) [collaborations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx6LAT-FqxU) with Tim & Eric for this loudly in the flesh.

As I said, I’m very used to Zach’s dark humor. What took me by surprise in Baskets was the *softness*, especially in Season 2. In particular, Louie Anderson’s turn as Christine Baskets, the kind, simple, and lonely mother, has legitimately blown my mind.

Anderson takes on the role of a woman not with a nudge and a wink, but with the same subtle grace that Jeffrey Tambor originally showed in the lead role of Transparent. In this case though, the show is not addressing trans issues- this is just a male tapping into the universality of human suffering very convincingly in a woman’s role.

The same way a good Todd Solondz film triggers the instinct to turn off the screen to escape deeply perverse cringe scenes, I’m stirred at times to stop watching Christine Baskets scenes because I’m not quite sure I can take how quietly my heart is breaking for her. How much she deserves just a little bit of happiness in her life, to feel loved. God help me, I sure never predicted I’d ever weep tears of solidarity for Louis Anderson in a dress.

So what can I really say about Baskets, overall? I can certainly say to the powers that be: keep giving Galifianakis roles that allow for this unique, complex range of emotions and techniques to shine.

And for the love of god, people, please watch [Visioneers](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/78358). It’s in my top 5 of all time for sure. It’s a 1984 ripoff that’s infinitely better than 1984 itself — to be able to exceed the original trope you’re lampooning is, I think, an admirable feat.
