title: WAP (What an Awkward Post)
---

This is my first post in half a year, because I've got a great incentive. I appreciate [Rhys Lindmark's exploration of the seeming dissonance between empowerment/objectification lenses](https://www.rhyslindmark.com/does-wap-empower-or-objectify-women/) on the [Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion single "Wet Ass Pussy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsm4poTWjMs). 

I was honoured that Rhys wanted to hear my thoughts- as a privileged former sex worker with what John Waters might call "Gender Troubles," I feel uniquely positioned to add my perspective here, inconclusive though it may ultimately seem. First let me give the contextual rundown.

I heard about the song before hearing the song itself, and kind of dreaded the first time it got inevitably slotted into my Spotify Release Radar. Despite my comparatively seedy past, I have a long-standing awkward distaste for pretty much any songs with explicitly sexual lyrics. I don't care the genre or the vocalist's gender- it feels cringe to me, particularly when going into microscopic physiological detail about someone's body. It just feels awkward and rude to listen to. I have spent so much goddamn time skipping through crude skits on 90s rap albums for this very reason. Just, ew, guys. We all love sex but get a room.

Mind you, such songs have their damn place. As a stripper, I enjoyed nothing more than ["apple bottom jeans and the boots with the fur"](https://youtu.be/U2waT9TxPU0). Outside of the hallowed walls of Spaces Actually Dedicated to Sex Work, though, I'm completely solid on all graphic lyrical objectification of the human body.
