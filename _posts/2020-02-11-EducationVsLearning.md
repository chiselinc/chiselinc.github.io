title: "Education" Versus "Learning"

---

This is something I've been mulling over for a bit. I've seen a number of conflicts on the internet, especially that old classic ragestage Twitter, arising from various inferences being made around the implications of the term "education." At first, this seemed strange to me- I've loved school and education for as long as I can remember, almost romanticized it before first attending. But upon careful reflection, I'm beginning to recognize the coercive elements of what we refer to as "education". It starts to come to the surface when you ask "what *is* the difference between 'learning' and 'being educated?'"

To me, "education" was always the preferential term because of the sense of purpose and mission which accompanies it. Education aims to accomplish something- it outlines these objectives, ideally in clear and actionable bulletpoints. The agenda and projected outcomes are writ clear from the outset, via syllabi and course descriptions. But the underlying ideology- the purpose and lynchpin of any given context of "education"- is not writ so clear.

I began to realize that I embrace the term "education" with both ease and trust because mainstream education has never been used to alienate me, or confuse me about who I am. I have had relatively easy pathways through the mainstream schooling system-- my enthusiasm and passion didn't hurt, but they weren't the origin of this ease.

I remember some extreme discomfort in elementary school, when my 4th grade teacher was being verbally abusive to some of my peers. For some goddamn reason, she had taken a shine to me, so there was this weird subcurrent of completely inappropriate communication where she'd undercut a student she *didn't* like, then say something to butter me up. It was the day she chewed out a kid for being "stupid" then touched the edge of my desk as she returned to the front of the room, saying "I'm sorry you had to see that, Chelsea," that I knew I had to take action.

If the kids she was insulting and belittling had gone to their parents, they hadn't believed them or taken action. When I went to my loving and supportive parents, they had my back right away. My mom (perhaps ill-advisedly but what are you gonna do in a situation like this?) gave me a mini cassette recorder, and the next time Miss Nixon went on a rampage about how stupid some kid was, I got it on tape. 

The school went into damage control mode-- the Assistant Principal got me alone in her office, I still remember her telling me "you could go to jail for recording someone without their permission." You see, the emotional abuse of small children by an elderly tenured monster wasn't the issue- wiretapping laws were really the priority for this ten year old. 

According to my parents, when they came in to raise hell and demand consequences, they were made to sit in particularly tiny chairs and attempts at vague intimidation were instigated. My dad is an old biker who doesn't take to intimidation any more than I do, so that shit didn't fly, and Miss Nixon ended her career with a significant red mark in her file (no more than that though).

I recount all of this because it's the best tiny slice I have to understand what it must be like to navigate educational institutions with the completely reasonable assumption that they're pitted against you. I've been really lucky to find the home I have in the halls of universities- they're the only place that really makes sense to me as an adult, and I'll probably spend lots of my time in such settings in the years to come. I try to always be mindful that this is an incredibly lucky take to have. And most of all, I try to remember when I lecture or facilitate that I'm there to help people learn, not to forcibly **educate** them.
