# What have you stumbled upon?

This is Chelsea Palmer's personal blog, built on a forked template from [Sustain](https://jekyller.github.io/sustain/), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and freely
hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using it to jump back into learning to ship my own site and assorted content


## Todos

* Figure out why jekyll serve is failing locally
* Populate resume/CV content
* Populate projects pages
* Create and populate interests page
* Populate contact page
* Redirect www.chelseakpalmer.com to gh-pages
