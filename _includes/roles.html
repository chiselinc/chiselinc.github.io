	<br>
      Do not shill me your token and do not send me a spray-and-pray form email. I will delete them.
      <br>
      When I connect with innovative social good projects, my loyalty is unwavering. If you're making the world a better
	place, I want to signal boost.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Event Operations Roles</a></strong>
			<br>
      Let me help you architect your conference or meetup from scratch, or just come lend a hand during the event itself.
      I can bring the majority of my own supplies, including specialized A/V and comms equipment.
		</h5>
    	<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Writing and Documentation Roles</a></strong>
			<br>
      I'm available for hire by project contract or hourly as a technical writer and copyeditor, and by project contract for journalism and academic writing.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Advisory and Consulting Roles</a></strong>
			<br>
     Book an hour of my time, pitch me on your project idea, and let me poke holes in
      it so you can build it stronger: my 4+ years in Bitcoin education, combined with a Master's degree focused on 
	program assessment, give me a unique edge for critically deconstructing blockchain startup ideas.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Education Roles</a></strong>
			<br>
      I have been onboarding broad audiences of newcomers to Linux and open source software for more than 6 years,
      and Bitcoin for more than 4 years. I can teach these and related technical topics, as well as critical theory,
	in small group seminar format or large conference speech-and-slides format.
		</h5>
<!–– 		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Performance Roles</a></strong>
			<br>
      I have a wide range of experience in voice and film acting and still photography modelling.
      <br>
      Work ranges from voice recording for computer systems, audiobooks, and ASMR, to original
      rap performances in-studio or at events, to fashion or boudoir photography. If you have
      a creative vision, contact me-- I have lots of costumes, wigs, and wild ideas kicking around.
